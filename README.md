## Instructions to build, install and use this project

This project is created for a SMS Chatbot order of food and is implemented in node.js javascript framework.  Installation is not required but customers add to contacts or remember the restaurant number to send sms to place orders.

This app facilitates an order ChatBot for a restaurant's food. Customers writes SMS to place orders. The restaurant offers 2 items on the menu and each of the items has size and topping options for the customers to choose from. There are also up-sell items like Drinks and Dessert that customers may include in their order. At the end of the orders, the customers will get their bill amount for them to pay and also will know when they will receive their food. Customers will also have an option to pay their bills using debit / credit card.


## Reason for choice of License

Create an order bot for your favourite food. You need to have at least 2 items on the menu unless your favourite food is pizza in which case you need to have 3 (I did pizza already). The menu items need to have size and one other attribute like toppings. You also need an up-sell item like drinks in the example.

### Marking
